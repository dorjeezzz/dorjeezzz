# Hi there! I'm Dorjee

Welcome to my Github profile! I am currently learning Python and JavaScript. I main C++

## About Me
```cpp
class Dorjee{
private:
  int age = 19;
public:
  string school = "University of Colorado at Boulder";
  vector<string> personality = {"funny", "funny-looking", "nerd"};
  vector<string> hobbies = {"coding!", "dancing", "hiking", "reading", "anime", "music", "exercise"};
};
```
I picked up programming in high school because it was the only weighted elective, yet I quickly found myself to enjoy the ability to create anything I wanted. I am currently a rising third year looking to improve my skillset and land an internship at big tech for Summer 2025.
